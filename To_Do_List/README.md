# To-Do List

Welcome to the To-Do List project! This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple yet functional to-do list application. It also leverages `localStorage` to store and retrieve tasks.

## Project Overview

The To-Do List project is designed to help users keep track of their tasks. The application allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so they persist even when the page is refreshed.

## Problem Statement

Create a To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks should be stored in `localStorage` and retrieved from there when the application loads. Ensure the application is responsive and visually appealing.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Allows users to add new tasks to the list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Allows users to remove tasks from the list.
- **Mark as Completed:** Allows users to mark tasks as completed.
- **Persistent Storage:** Stores tasks in `localStorage` to persist data across sessions.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the application looks great on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** The structure of the application.
- **CSS3:** Styling the application with modern CSS techniques.
- **JavaScript:** Adding interactivity and handling `localStorage`.

## Usage

Once you have the project set up locally, you can start using the To-Do List application. Add tasks by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add" button. Tasks will be saved in `localStorage` and will be loaded automatically when you revisit the page.
