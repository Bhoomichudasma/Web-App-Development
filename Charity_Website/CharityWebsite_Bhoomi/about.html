		    <h1>Your donations have changed lives</h1>
		    <p>Through the support of our donors, Bal Raksha Bharat has been implementing projects to cater to children’s various needs, making their childhood happier and more fulfilling. We are working relentlessly to give children a chance at building a brighter future. And in this quest, every bit of support counts.</p>
		    <h1>Save the children</h1>
		    <p>Children’s lives, safety, well-being, and futures are under attack in an increasingly dangerous and unequal world.Education is indispensable for children as it forms the bedrock upon which their future success and well-being are built. Beyond imparting knowledge and academic skills, education cultivates critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and creativity.During the course of building and running free schools, The Art of Living teams have encountered and addressed innumerable challenges. We have learned that teaching our children is perhaps the easiest process in the entire cycle. Changing the mind-set of the surrounding community and helping them to see the value of education, however, poses significant challenges, and this has been the unique value that the Art of Living has brought into the space of value-based education.

            Nearly 300 million people – or 1 in 27 people – are expected to need humanitarian assistance this year. We will aim to assist 15.9 million children across 46 countries in response to the most significant threat to children’s rights in recent memory.

            Together, we will ensure no child is left behind. Join us!</p>
