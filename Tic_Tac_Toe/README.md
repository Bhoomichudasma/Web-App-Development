# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game project! This project uses Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques to build a GUI version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. You can use any GUI library like Tkinter, Turtle, or Pygame. The project includes multiple commits and pictures of the game in this README file.

## Project Overview

The Tic-Tac-Toe Game project aims to create an interactive and visually appealing version of the classic game using Python. It utilizes OOP principles for structure and design, and incorporates a GUI for an enhanced user experience.

## Problem Statement

Use OOP techniques to build a GUI game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You can use any library to make the GUI (Tkinter, Turtle, or Pygame). Upload this project on GitHub with multiple commits and add pictures of the game to the README file. The project should use a virtual environment, and a requirements file should be included in the GitHub repository.

## Features

- **OOP Design:** Ensures the game is modular and scalable.
- **GUI Interface:** Provides an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The programming language used for the game logic and GUI.
- **Tkinter/Turtle/Pygame:** The libraries used to create the GUI.
